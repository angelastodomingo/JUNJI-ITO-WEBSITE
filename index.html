    <p>Hey there. I'm a single web developer who loves Junji Ito's stuff so I made this fan website to share it with even more people in the world, because he deserves all the support he gets. His work is phenomenal, and you should seriously check him out if you haven't heard of him before. So hey, if you encounter any bugs you see on this site, lemme know! I'm still new to this stuff... Oh yeah, all the cool artwork you see are made by Junji Ito. All credit goes to him! Also, sorry if the japanese doesn't make sense. Okay, I'll stop rambling now!

<div class="biographyparagraph">
    <p>Junji Ito was born on July 31, 1963 in Nakatsugawa City, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. After graduating from high school, he attended a technical school for dental prosthetics, even working in the area for a while. The desire to show his work with comics to the great master of horror Kazuo Umezz, however, led him to compete for the newly created Umezz Award for new talents, organized by the Monthly Halloween Magazine (publisher Asahi Sonorama) since 1986. In the very first edition of the event, Tomie, his debut work, received an honorable mention and became his most representative work. Three years later, Ito quit his job as a prosthetic technician and began to dedicate himself exclusively to his career as a comic artist, presenting to the world masterpieces such as Town without Streets, The Hanging Balloons, the Souichi series and the award-winning Lovesick Dead. Fame came in 1998 with the Uzumaki series, published in the Big Comic Spirits magazine (Shogakukan publisher), and other peerless titles such as Gyo and Crushing Tales have followed since then.
